# NumberGuesser

/////Fernando: i used https://github.com/landoncass/NumberGuesser/blob/trunk/Program.cs as a reference code.

In this project, you will use C# to recreate the favorite childrens game of "I'm thiking of a number between 1 and ...."

In this game, the code will try to guess the number the player is thinking of. The computer will not ask the user for their number at the beginning of the game, but guess it.

//Objectives

    Demonstrate usage of methods to organize code.
    Understand and implement algorithms.
    Understand loops.

Requirements

    Your program should be able to handle a person thinking of a number between 1 and 1024.
    Your program should assume the human player would answer any guess truthfully.

//Explorer Mode//

    //Once the program starts, you should display a greeting to the user describing the challenge.

    //Ask the user to think of a number between 1 and 1024.

    //Do NOT prompt the user for their number. Your program will guess the number IN THEIR MIND

    //Prompt the user with your guess and allow them to tell you if their number is higher, lower, or correct.

    //Keep refining your guess until you have the correct answer.

    Use methods to organize your code. Here are some suggestions for methods you might use:
        ShowGreeting
        ComputeNewLowIfTooLow
        ComputeNewHighIfTooHigh
        BragWhenCorrect
    Use at least one or two methods
